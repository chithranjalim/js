    <h1>For loop that will iterate from 0 to 15</h1>
    <p>question: Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, check if the current number is odd or even, and display the message to the screen as odd or even.</p>
    <p>go to console to see the result!</p>

 <script>
      
for (var x=0; x<=15; x++) {
        if (x === 0) {
                console.log(x +  " is even");
        }
        else if (x % 2 === 0) {
                console.log(x + " is even");   
        }
        else {
                console.log(x + " is odd");
        }
}
